 Mini Science Course (All-in-One Chapter)
Chapter: The Basics of Everyday Science
1. Introduction: What is Science?
Science is the study of the natural world through observation, questioning, testing, and reasoning. It
helps us understand how things work and why they happen.
Scientific Method:
Ask a question 
Make a guess (hypothesis) 
Test with an experiment 
Observe the results 
Conclude and share 
Example:  Why does ice melt? → Test by leaving ice in the sun → Observe melting → Conclude: heat
changes ice to water.
2. Matter – The Building Block of Everything
Matter = anything that has mass and takes up space.
States of Matter:
Solid: fixed shape (example: ice, rock)
Liquid: flows, takes container’s shape (example: water, milk)
Gas: spreads everywhere (example: air, steam)
Experiment: Take ice cubes → watch them melt into water → heat the water and watch it turn to steam.
This shows how matter changes with temperature.
3. Energy and Motion
Energy makes things happen. Types:
Heat
Light
Sound
Mechanical (movement)
Electrical

Gravity: pulls objects down (apples fall, we stay on Earth).
Friction: slows things when they rub together.
Push and Pull: basic ways of moving objects.
Activity: Roll a ball on smooth floor vs. rough carpet → see how friction changes motion.
4. Life Science Basics
All living things are made of cells (tiny building blocks).
Plants vs. Animals:
Plants: make food with sunlight (photosynthesis).
Animals: eat plants or other animals.
Human Body Systems:
Respiratory system: breathing, lungs bring in oxygen.
Circulatory system: heart pumps blood.
Digestive system: turns food into energy.
Quick Quiz: Which system helps us breathe? (Answer: Respiratory)
5. Earth and Space
Water Cycle: Water evaporates (heat) → forms clouds → falls as rain → flows into rivers and oceans
→ repeats.
Ecosystems: Plants, animals, and environment working together.
Space Facts:
Earth orbits the Sun.
Moon orbits the Earth.
Sunlight takes 8 minutes to reach Earth.
Fun Activity: Put a little water in a clear jar, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the sun. Watch how water
evaporates and condenses inside – a mini water cycle!
6. Recap (Key Points)
Science helps us ask and answer questions. 
Matter exists in 3 main states: solid, liquid, gas.

Energy and forces cause movement and change. 
Life is built from cells; humans have organ systems. 
Earth recycles water and belongs to a vast universe.
